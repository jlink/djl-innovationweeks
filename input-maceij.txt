Machine Learning with Java

- Until 4 years ago, main approach was using Spark ML
- Then came Google Vertix and Stagemaker
- Sometimes dockerizing the Python code and running it in Java works
- Onnx is a more recent approach: https://onnx.ai/
  The latest approaches are usually not there (yet)
    - Java Binding: https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/get-started/with-java.html
    - Only binding to existing models not to train new models
- DJL less mature and less common than ONNX
